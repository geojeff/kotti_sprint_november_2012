This is the archived "November 2012 Kotti Sprint" which was hosted by geojeff,
and with participating in irc by several Kotti developers. The content in the
db was created and modified by geojeff as discussion progress over several
weeks, so most of it contains his biases.

To reconstitute,

* Set up a virtualenv
* do pip install -r requirements.txt and requirements-for-add-ons.txt

This gets Kotti 0.8b1 and the versions of kotti_software, kotti_forum,
and kotti_todos as they ended up after the sprint, in early January 2013.
